# AdvancedReactSetup
**Advanced setup for React project using webpack, babel, eslint etc.**

Hello unknown visitor. 
I have made this repo to bootstrap development of my personal projects in react. It contains all of the up to date libraries to get you up and going with react + webpack + babel setup + custom dev server (without "real" dev server).

It is plain and simple and there is no Redux in it. (sorry, still learning)

It is best used as starting point for development. If you are in need for more you can check out my [other repo](https://github.com/Uraharadono/ReactTodo) from which you can copy components (buttons, alerts, modals etc.) and utilities (bootstrap, font awesome) etc. from it to here and it should work.
 

All of the explanations of packages and why/what was used in this project can be found in package.json.explanation.js file.
